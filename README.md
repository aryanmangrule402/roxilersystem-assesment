Getting Started
Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally.

Prerequisites
Node.js (LTS version recommended)

npm (comes with Node.js)

A PostgreSQL database instance (cloud-hosted like Aiven, or local)

For Aiven: Ensure your DB_HOST, DB_PORT, DB_USER, DB_PASSWORD, DB_DATABASE are correctly set in the backend .env.

For Local: Ensure PostgreSQL is installed and running, and update .env accordingly (e.g., DB_HOST=localhost, DB_PORT=5432).

sequelize-cli installed globally: npm install -g sequelize-cli

Backend Setup
Navigate to the backend directory:

Bash

cd backend
Install dependencies:

Bash

npm install
Create .env file:
Create a file named .env in the backend/ directory and add your database and JWT configuration. Do NOT commit this file to public repositories.

Code snippet

DB_HOST=roxiler-postgres-db-mangrulearyan402-61f2.c.aivencloud.com
DB_PORT=24062
DB_USER=avnadmin
DB_PASSWORD=
DB_DATABASE=defaultdb
JWT_SECRET=e5f1cae7b3477911f63afe718f882a17e38d53afd24852eb8d377f0a061a209a
JWT_EXPIRES_IN=1h
PORT=5000
COOKIE_EXPIRE=1 # Expiration in days for HttpOnly cookie
NODE_ENV=development # or production
Make sure DB_HOST, DB_PORT, DB_USER, DB_PASSWORD, DB_DATABASE match your Aiven PostgreSQL credentials.

JWT_SECRET: Use a strong, unique string.

JWT_EXPIRES_IN: Defines token validity (e.g., 1h for 1 hour).

Database Synchronization (Table Creation):
The connectDB function in backend/config/database.js uses sequelize.sync({ alter: true }) to automatically create tables based on your models and update existing ones if changes are detected. This runs when the server starts.

Note: For more controlled schema management in larger projects, you would typically use Sequelize migrations (npm run db:migrate). For this challenge, sequelize.sync is sufficient.

Start the backend server:

Bash

npm run dev
The server will run on http://localhost:5000 (or the PORT specified in your .env). You should see console messages indicating successful database connection and model synchronization.

Frontend Setup
Navigate to the frontend directory:
